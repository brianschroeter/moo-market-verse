## Technical Implementation

  - `micro-interactions.css`: Global interaction patterns
  - Leveraged existing `hero.css` patterns for consistency

### Performance Considerations
- Used CSS transforms for smooth 60fps animations
- Implemented `will-change` for heavy animations
- Intersection Observer for on-demand animations
- Efficient keyframe animations with GPU acceleration

### Accessibility
- Maintained focus states for keyboard navigation
- Added transition delays for better readability
- Preserved contrast ratios in all animated elements

## Visual Consistency
- Maintained LolCow brand colors (blue, red, black, gray)
- Consistent animation timing and easing curves
- Cohesive visual language across all sections
- Complementary effects that enhance rather than distract

The homepage now features a rich, interactive experience with smooth animations and engaging micro-interactions while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility standards.
