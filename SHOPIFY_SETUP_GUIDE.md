# Shopify Setup Guide

## Quick Setup for Testing

Since you're ready to test the Shop functionality, here's how to set up the Shopify integration:

## Option 1: Test with Mock Data (Immediate Testing)

For immediate testing without Shopify credentials, the edge function will return mock data. You can test the UI functionality right now by visiting:

- **Shop Page**: http://localhost:8082/shop
- The app will show error states gracefully when no Shopify credentials are configured

## Option 2: Full Shopify Integration

### Step 1: Create Shopify Storefront API Access

1. **Go to your Shopify Admin**:
   - Navigate to: Apps â†’ App and sales channel settings â†’ Develop apps
   - Click "Create an app"
   - Name it: "LolCow Portal Integration"

2. **Configure Storefront API Scopes**:
   - Go to the "Configuration" tab
   - Under "Storefront API access scopes", enable:
     - âœ… `unauthenticated_read_product_listings`
     - âœ… `unauthenticated_read_product_inventory`
     - âœ… `unauthenticated_read_collection_listings`
     - âœ… `unauthenticated_read_product_tags`

3. **Install and Generate Token**:
   - Click "Install app" 
   - Copy the **Storefront access token** (starts with `shpat_`)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Supabase

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dlmbqojnhjsecajxltzj
   - Navigate to: Settings â†’ Edge Functions â†’ Environment Variables

2. **Add these secrets**:
   ```bash
   SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   SHOPIFY_SHOP_DOMAIN=your-shop-name.myshopify.com
   SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_VERSION=2024-04
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Integration

Once environment variables are set:

1. **Test the Edge Function directly**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://dlmbqojnhjsecajxltzj.supabase.co/functions/v1/shopify-storefront/collections"
   ```

2. **Test in the application**:
   - Visit: http://localhost:8082/shop
   - Collections should load from your Shopify store
   - Click on any collection to view products

## Current Status âœ…

### What's Working Now:
- âœ… Shop page loads with search functionality
- âœ… Navigation includes "Shop" link
- âœ… Collection browsing UI is complete
- âœ… Product grid with "Shop Now" buttons
- âœ… Error handling for missing credentials
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Edge function deployed and ready

### What Happens Without Shopify Credentials:
- Shop page shows a graceful error message
- UI components are fully functional
- Ready for immediate Shopify integration

## Quick Test Commands

### Test the Edge Function:
```bash
# Test collections endpoint
curl "https://dlmbqojnhjsecajxltzj.supabase.co/functions/v1/shopify-storefront/collections"

# Test specific collection (replace 'collection-handle' with actual handle)
curl "https://dlmbqojnhjsecajxltzj.supabase.co/functions/v1/shopify-storefront/collections/collection-handle"

# Test specific product (replace 'product-handle' with actual handle)
curl "https://dlmbqojnhjsecajxltzj.supabase.co/functions/v1/shopify-storefront/products/product-handle"
```

### Test the Frontend:
```bash
# Start dev server (already running)
npm run dev

# Visit these URLs:
# http://localhost:8082/shop - Main shop page
# http://localhost:8082/shop/any-collection - Collection page (will show 404 until Shopify is connected)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Missing Shopify configuration" error**: Environment variables not set in Supabase
2. **GraphQL errors**: Check Shopify API token permissions
3. **404 errors for collections**: Collection handles need to match exactly
4. **CORS errors**: Edge function handles CORS automatically

### Debug Steps:
1. Check Supabase Edge Function logs in dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test API token directly in Shopify GraphQL explorer
4. Check browser developer console for errors

## Next Steps

Once Shopify is connected, you can:
1. âœ… Browse all your collections
2. âœ… View products within collections
3. âœ… Search collections by name
4. âœ… Click through to purchase on Shopify
5. ðŸ”„ Implement product detail pages (Phase 2)
6. ðŸ”„ Add advanced search and filtering (Phase 3)

The foundation is complete and ready for your Shopify store!
