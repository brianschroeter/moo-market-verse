# Database Sync Status

## Current Status
The database sync has been partially successful. The local Supabase instance is running and has the schema properly set up with all migrations applied.

## What's Working
- ✅ Local Supabase is running at http://127.0.0.1:54321
- ✅ Database schema is fully migrated
- ✅ TypeScript types have been generated
- ✅ Basic data import is working (1 profile record imported)
- ✅ Supabase Studio is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:54323

## Known Issues
1. **IPv6 Network Issue**: The Docker containers are trying to connect to the production database via IPv6, which is not reachable from within Docker
2. **Limited Data**: Only 1 profile was synced, suggesting either:
   - The production database has minimal data
   - The sync was incomplete due to network issues
   - Authentication issues with the direct database connection

## Database Connection Details
- Host: `db.dlmbqojnhjsecajxltzj.supabase.co`
- Database: `postgres`
- User: `postgres`
- Password: Available in `.env.secrets`

## Scripts Created
1. `sync-production-db-docker.sh` - Docker-based sync approach
2. `sync-production-db-cli.sh` - Supabase CLI-based approach
3. `sync-production-db-final.sh` - Combined approach with fallbacks
4. `sync-production-db-host.sh` - Host-based approach (requires psql installed)

## Workarounds and Solutions

### Option 1: Install PostgreSQL Client
```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-client

# Then run
./scripts/sync-production-db-host.sh
```

### Option 2: Use Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dlmbqojnhjsecajxltzj
2. Navigate to Settings > Database
3. Use the built-in export functionality

### Option 3: Force IPv4 Connection
Configure your system to prefer IPv4 over IPv6 for the specific domain:
```bash
echo "$(getent hosts db.dlmbqojnhjsecajxltzj.supabase.co | grep -E '^[0-9]{1,3}\.' | head -1)" >> /etc/hosts
```

### Option 4: Use a Different Network
If you're on a network that blocks IPv6, try:
- Using a different network connection
- Using a VPN that supports IPv6
- Configuring Docker to use host networking

## Next Steps
1. **Verify Current Data**: Check Supabase Studio to see what data is available
2. **Sync Additional Data**: If needed, run the Shopify sync scripts:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/sync-shopify-orders.sh
   ```
3. **Test the Application**: Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Manual Data Verification
To check what data is in your local database:
```bash
docker exec $(docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}" | grep "supabase_db_" | head -1) \
  psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "
    SELECT schemaname, tablename 
    FROM pg_tables 
    WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
    ORDER BY tablename;"
```

## Conclusion
The database sync infrastructure is in place and working, but the actual data transfer is limited by network connectivity issues. The local development environment is ready for use with the schema properly set up.
