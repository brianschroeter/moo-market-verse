# Shop Page Migration Analysis

## Issues Identified

After migrating from Shopify API to database-first approach, the shop page had three critical issues:

1. **Product images not showing** - Only placeholder icons displayed
2. **Prices showing as "$NaN"** - Price formatting was failing
3. **All products showing as "Sold Out"** - Availability status was incorrect

## Root Cause

The `convertToProduct` function in `databaseProductService.ts` was converting database products to a different Product type structure than what the `ProductCard` component expected.

### Type Mismatches Found:

1. **Image Field**:
   - Database stores: `image_url` (string)
   - convertToProduct was creating: `images` (array of objects)
   - ProductCard expects: `featuredImageUrl` (optional string)

2. **Price Field**:
   - Database stores: `price` (number)
   - convertToProduct was creating: Complex `priceRange` with `minVariantPrice`/`maxVariantPrice` objects containing `amount` strings
   - ProductCard expects: Simple `priceRange` with `min`/`max` as numbers

3. **Availability Field**:
   - Database stores: `status` (string)
   - convertToProduct was using: `availableForSale` (boolean)
   - ProductCard expects: `available` (boolean)

## Solution Applied

Updated the `convertToProduct` function to match the expected Product interface:

```typescript
function convertToProduct(dbProduct: DatabaseProduct): Product {
  return {
    id: dbProduct.id,
    handle: dbProduct.handle,
    title: dbProduct.title,
    description: dbProduct.description || '',
    vendor: dbProduct.vendor,
    productType: dbProduct.product_type,
    tags: dbProduct.tags,
    featuredImageUrl: dbProduct.image_url || undefined,
    priceRange: {
      min: dbProduct.price,
      max: dbProduct.price,
      currencyCode: 'USD'
    },
    available: dbProduct.status === 'active'
  };
}
```

Also updated `convertToCollection` to match the Collection interface and added database-first approach for collections in the Shop page.

## Next Steps

1. **Sync Shopify data** to populate the database tables
2. **Verify the fixes** work with real product data
3. **Monitor performance** improvements from database-first approach

## Files Modified

- `/src/services/shopify/databaseProductService.ts` - Fixed type conversion functions
- `/src/pages/Shop.tsx` - Added database-first approach for collections
